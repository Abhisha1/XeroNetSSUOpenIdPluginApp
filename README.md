# Xero NetStandard Sign Up With Xero App
This is a sample app that has been built with the Xero NetStandard SDK to show how app partners build the Sign Up With Xero Recommended flow.

This sample app demonstrates how Xero can be used as an identity provider to create an account for your app. In order to run this application, users must have the following:
- A Xero app created with the credentials ready to use. See [Create a Xero app](#create-a-xero-app)
- A local instance of a MySQL Database running. See [Create a local database](#create-a-local-database)

## What is Sign Up With Xero Recommended Flow?
Xero can be used as an identity provider. This is where a user can use their Xero account to sign up to another service. 
App partners are required to implement the sign up with xero as part of their certification, and this demo shows a sample of how an app
may use Xero to create an account. 

For more information about this process, refer to the [Sign Up with Xero blog post](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/xero-app-store/app-partner-guides/sign-up/) or the awesome [Sign Up with Xero explainer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpFGHti5Y17Q%26t%3D2s%26ab_channel%3DXeroDeveloper&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1664933858033865&usg=AOvVaw3V1VrIUyyRpdPc8LgtN4xH) video Lee has created.


### Create a Xero app
You will need your Xero app credentials created to run this demo app.

To obtain your API keys, follow these steps:

* Create a [free Xero user account](https://www.xero.com/us/signup/api/) (if you don't have one)
* Login to [Xero developer center](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
* Click "New App" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url.
* Enter the redirect URI (your callback url - i.e. `https://localhost:5001/Authorization/Callback`)
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. You secret is now hidden.

### Download the code
Clone this repo to your local drive or open with GitHub desktop client.

### Configure your API Keys
In /XeroNetSSUApp/appsettings.json, you should populate your XeroConfiguration as such: 

```json
  "XeroConfiguration": {
    "ClientId": "YOUR_XERO_APP_CLIENT_ID",
    "ClientSecret": "YOUR_XERO_APP_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "CallbackUri": "https://localhost:5001/Authorization/Callback",
    "Scope": "openid offline_access profile ... ",
    "State": "YOUR_STATE"
  }
```

Note that you will have to have a state. The CallbackUri has to be exactly the same as redirect URI you put in Xero developer portal letter by letter. 

### Create a local database

For the purpose of mocking an authentication system, the app spins up a local database called Test in which a database table called "User" is created. This table will contain all the users that will be registered using Xero as an identity provider.

In order to create the database, we recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio.
1. Load the sample application in Microsoft Visual Studio
2. Open SQL Server Object Explorer. This should open in a left pane.
3. If you have an existing SQL Server available, select the expand button on the server to reveal a Databases folder.
4. Right click on the Databases folder. Click 'Add new Database'
5. Add a name and click Ok to create the database.
6. Once the database is created, right click on your newly created databases name and select properties.
7. The properties should display in the bottom left pane. Scroll and find the connection string. If only a few properties didplay, right click again on the database name and click refresh and then click properties again until the connection string appears.
8. Copy the connection string and replace in the appsettings.json as shown below:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
        "Database": "Data Source=(localdb)\\ProjectsV13..."
    }
```

## Some explanation of the code

### Authorization Controller
#### Signing up
The Authorization Controller handles the logic of using Xero as an identity provider. Once the user selects the connect to Xero option, they are redirected to the callback URI. This initiates a connection to Xero via the standard OAuth 2.0 flow. Once the user authorises the connection, the sample app receives tokens that can be used to access the Xero API and identity details. As we want to use Xero to 
create an account, we use decode and parse the ID token returned to extract out user information (name, email, Xero user ID) which is then fed directly into the sample app's registration process (creating a user in the local mySQL database).
